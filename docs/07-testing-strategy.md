# 07 · Testing Strategy — TDD is mandatory

## 1. Policy (repo law)

1. **No production code without a failing test first.** Workflow per unit:
   red (test encodes a requirement ID) → green (minimal implementation) →
   refactor (stay green).
2. Every test file references the FR IDs it encodes in its top comment; the
   roadmap task is "done" only when its FR tests pass.
3. `pnpm check` (typecheck + tests + build) must be green before any commit is
   considered final. CI runs the same gate.

## 2. Layers & tools

| Layer            | Tool                             | What is tested                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `domain/` (pure) | Vitest (node env)                | Geometry math, document mutations/invariants, kit copy-on-write, validation, migration, playback timing with **fake clocks**, blink determinism, ambient math                  |
| `render/` (pure) | Vitest (node env)                | Scene building from fixtures; **byte-exact** SVG serialization (golden strings); determinism (same input → same bytes)                                                         |
| `export/`        | Vitest                           | Avatar/project file builders (round-trip: export → validate → import → deep-equal), loop pruning, orphan-mood pruning, error codes                                             |
| `app/` UI        | Vitest + Testing Library (jsdom) | User flows: create bubble, edit mood deltas with cancel restoring stage, linked-eye mirroring, loop step reorder keeps moodId, import confirmation gate, i18n key parity es/en |
| `runtime/`       | Vitest + Testing Library         | Renders resting face from a definition; starts/pauses; identical SVG vs studio for same state (FR-10.4)                                                                        |
| Visual smoke     | Playwright (F5 only)             | Screenshots of studio boot, each panel, a playing loop; manual review vs `05-ui-design.md`                                                                                     |

## 3. Timing tests (the critical ones — FR-6.3)

`LoopPlayer` is advanced with an injected clock:

```ts
const p = new LoopPlayer(loop, moods);
p.advance(0);
p.advance(1000); // 1 big frame
const q = new LoopPlayer(loop, moods);
for (let t = 0; t <= 1000; t += 16) q.advance(t); // 62 small frames
expect(stateOf(p)).toEqual(stateOf(q)); // frame-rate independence
```

Blink uses a seeded PRNG: same seed → same schedule (assert exact interval
sequence); ambient is a pure function of `(t, config)` (assert zero offset at
t=0 and periodicity).

## 4. Fixtures

`src/test/fixtures/` — canonical documents: `minimal.json` (1 bubble, no kit),
`full.json` (2 bubbles, own kit on #2, 3 moods, 2 loops incl. pingpong),
`invalid/` cases per validation rule (E_VERSION, broken ref, bad color…).
Fixtures are typed (`satisfies StudioDocument`) so schema drift breaks tests.

## 5. Regression discipline

Any bug fix lands with the test that reproduces it (red → green). Golden SVG
files change only with an explicit snapshot update in the same diff, reviewed
visually (F5 screenshots) when geometry is touched.
